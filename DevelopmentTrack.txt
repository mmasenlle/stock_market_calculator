 Data feed program I
--------------------
 -Start ccltor_feeder
  +Main loop
  +Check date and time
  +Fetch page
  +Parse page
  +Basic configuration
Comments:
The parse will be split in two parts: one that will be handled with an
external program/script, and other built-in. This way we can have separate
parser for different sources. The first parser will translate the data to a
well known xml sintax that the built-in parser will handle. The external
parsers will be created when needed, and will be expecified in the
configuration with the url.
