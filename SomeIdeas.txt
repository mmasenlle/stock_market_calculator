 Expert system
-----------------
 Something to go through the data looking for things (trends, predictions). It
 has to have some rules or something and when various predictions or other
 things match for the same thing, to ring the bell. Something like that. Maybe
 with plugins to see the differents things, with and output or something
 normalized, when various match ...

 Prediction checker
--------------------
 Something to go checking the historic predictions and storing the rate of
 match in order to get the idea of accuracy of different methods. This data
 can be used to tune the expert system and to know the fiability.
